INTEGRATED SENSOR
The Encounter and Encounter HP with Integrated Sensor technology provides automatic energy savings without sacrificing
performance. Traditionally, these types of energy savings required coordination between the luminaire and a lighting control
system. The Encounter delivers superior lighting with integrated occupancy and daylighting controls.
Capture the benefits of traditional lighting controls, without complicated coverage planning or special wiring.
Ideal for new construction or retrofit, the Encounter delivers automatic ON to an energy saving light level,
while ensuring lighting is turned OFF when the space is unoccupied.
The integral daylight sensor reduces the need for special daylight zone planning. Each luminaire will
automatically adjust the light level based on reflected light beneath the sensor in a closed loop method.
Occupied daylight light levels and unoccupied light levels can be adjusted using the integrated sensor
programming remote (Catalog Number: ISHH-01). The integrated sensor personal remote (Catalog Number: ISHH-02)
provides code compliant manual raise, lower, ON, OFF control.
The Encounter with Integrated Sensor is easy to install with no special wiring and ensures energy savings out-of-the-box
with default control settings.
How it works:
•
As the user enters the space controlled by the integral sensor, the lighting turns ON to the default daylight level.
•
Lighting will remain at that the daylight level until the space is unoccupied. This will start the occupancy timeout period (default 20 minutes).
•
If the space remains unoccupied for half of the timeout period, the lighting will automatically reduce to the Energy Saver light level. This adjustable
light level is typically half of the occupied daylight level.
•
At the end of the timeout period the lighting will go to the unoccupied light level. This adjustable light level uses the OFF default setting.

1. 4ft Luminaire photometry has been conducted in accordance with IES LM-79-08. IES files can be downloaded by clicking the links in the table above, or online at ledalite.com. Luminaires with finishes other than
standard white may result in a drop in flux and efficacy.
2. Unified Glare Ratio (UGR) is calculated in accordance with CIE 117-1995. Reference conditions of 4Hx8Hx1H and reflectances of 70/50/20% have been applied using the procedure described in CIE 190-2010.
3. For Photometry reports and IES files combining Direct/Indirect distributions other than those listed above, please consult Ledalite.

1. 4ft Luminaire photometry has been conducted in accordance with IES LM-79-08. IES files can be downloaded by clicking the links in the table above, or online at ledalite.com. Luminaires with finishes other than
standard white may result in a drop in flux and efficacy.
2. Unified Glare Ratio (UGR) is calculated in accordance with CIE 117-1995. Reference conditions of 4Hx8Hx1H and reflectances of 70/50/20% have been applied using the procedure described in CIE 190-2010.
3. For Photometry reports and IES files combining Direct/Indirect distributions other than those listed above, please consult Ledalite.

Controlling VividTune Tunable White
VividTune luminaires make tunable white more accessible by using simple and familiar
controls. From wall dimmers to wireless controls, VividTune tunable white luminaires are
compatible with industry standard 0-10V dimming controls. A single
0-10V dimming input is used to control intensity (brightness) while a second 0-10V
dimming input is used to adjust CCT. For suggested control configurations,
go to www.cooperlighting.com for tunable white application guides.

Projected LED Lumen Maintenance
Lumen Ambient Temperature (LAT) Multipliers
Data references the extrapolated performance projections for the platform noted in a 25°C
Use these factors to determine relative lumen output for
ambient, based on 10,000 hours of LED testing (tested per IESNA LM-80-08 and projected per
average ambient temperatures from 0-40°C (32-104°F).
IESNA TM-21-11).
To calculate LLF, use the lumen maintenance factor that corresponds to the desired number of

MCASE+TM Series
Cartridge Fuses – Rated 32V
RoHS
Description
MCASE+TM cartridge fuses protect automotive circuits from inrushes
of current while taking up minimal space. Unslotted MCASE+ fuses
mount on 2.8 mm terminals, and Slotted MCASE+ fuses can mount
on bus bars or 6.3 mm terminals. MCASE+ High Temperature fuses
produce a lower voltage drop and experience a lower temperature
rise when subjected to harsher conditions.
HT
09
Note that the current-carrying capability of the mating terminals
must be verified to ensure proper system operation. Please contact
Littelfuse for details regarding the test setup definition, which refers
to ISO 8820-4 (Plated Mating Tab Terminals).

Description
The NANO2® Slo-Blo® fuse has enhanced inrush withstand
characteristics over the NANO2® Fast-Acting fuse. The unique time
delay feature of this fuse design helps solve the problem of
nuisance “opening” by accommodating inrush currents that
normally cause a fast-acting fuse to open.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Types of fans and their function
Axial fans:
High air flow with medium to relatively high pressure build-up
The air flow in axial fans, whose impeller is similar to that of a propeller, is conducted to a great
extent parallel to the axis of rotation, in other words in the axial direction. Axial fans with free air
delivery at zero static pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing back
pressure. Axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly equipped with external hous-
ing and an electric motor integrated into the fan hub. This compact design allows space-saving
accommodation of all devices; the flange is equipped with mounting holes.
Diagonal fans:
High flow rate at relatively high pressure build-up
At first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans. Intake is axial, whereas exhaust
is diagonal. Due to the conical shape of the wheel and housing, the air is pressurised more. In
direct comparison with axial fans of the same size and comparable performance, these fans are
distinguished by the lower operating noise at high pressures.
Centrifugal fans:
High pressure build-up at limited flow rate
Many of the cooling problems that occur can be optimally solved by axial and/or diagonal fans.
If, for example, the required cooling air has to be conducted at an angle of 90° or if even high
pressure is necessary, centrifugal fans are more effective. For your application, ebm-papst
offers not only complete centrifugal fans but also motor/impeller combinations without external
housing.
Tangential fans:
High flow rate at low pressure
Tangential fans are used above all-, for large-surface air flow in devices. The air flows through
the roller-shaped impellers twice in the radial direction: in the intake area from the outside to
the inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the outside. Whirls form in the roller due to
the vanes which guarantee a steady flow of air through the impeller.

Connection instructions for S-Force fans
Special features of S-Force fans
The S-Force series is the most powerful product series on the market. S-Force stands for the highest innovation in motor technology, fluid mecha-
nics and electronics. The one-of-a-kind power density of the products requires special attention to the application at the customer's facility.
Service life
Due to the high currents in the fans, the load on the electrolyte capaci-
+Vs
tors is greater, which reduces the service life of the capacitor. As a lar-
Power
ger or additional capacitor cannot be housed in the fan, the capacitor
Supply
M
must be housed in the supply line.
Micro-
controller
If the power pack of the application has a corresponding capacitor, in
GND
some cases it may be possible to omit the external capacitor.
Recommended measure: Additional external capa-
citor (thus must be installed as close to the fan as
possible < 30 cm).

Technical information
Progress made by ebm-papst
The best example: The ACmaxx fans from ebm-papst, which, thanks to an
ingenious yet simple improvement over conventional AC fans, provide
substantial benefits.
The aim in developing the new ACmaxx series was to raise the technology
standard of the conventional AC fan significantly and, in the process, facil-
itate the transition to the new technology by retaining the overall mount-
ing dimensions. In short, to ensure the fans can be replaced 1:1 without
any peripheral changes or changes to the voltage situation.
ebm-papst offers two generations of ACmaxx products that meet different
needs.

What ACmaxx and i-maxx have in common:
Energy efficiency
Long service life
The drive concept is based on state-of-the-art GreenTech EC technology
The efficiency of ACmaxx and i-maxx motors is up to 75% higher than that
with outstanding motor efficiency. Compared to AC fans of the same size,
of conventional AC fan variants. This not only saves energy, it also means
ACmaxx energy consumption is up to 77% lower–for higher cooling capa-
less intrinsic heating in the motor. The reduced heating has a direct, positi-
city! The energy balance alone means that the products pay for themsel-
ve effect on the bearing system, which is why the fans have a service life

that is up to 85% longer! This also lengthens the service and maintenance

expensive downtimes, are kept to a manageable minimum.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard-
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings,
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Types of fans
and their function
Axial fans: High air flow with medium
to relatively high pressure increase
The air flow in axial fans with an impeller that is similar to a propeller
is conducted largely parallel to the axis of rotation, in other words
in the axial direction. Axial fans with free air delivery at zero static
pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing back
pressure. Axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly

equipped with external housing. The electric motor is integrated in
the fan hub. This compact design allows space-saving accommodation
of all devices. The flange is equipped with mounting holes.
Diagonal fans: High air flow
at relatively high pressure increase
At first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans.
Intake is axial, whereas exhaust is diagonal. Due to the conical
shape of the wheel and housing, the air is pressurized more in the
diagonal fan. In direct comparison with axial fans of the same size
and comparable performance, these fans are distinguished by the
lower operating noise at high pressures.
Centrifugal fans: High pressure
111
increase at limited flow rate
Generally, many cooling tasks can be performed excellently by
axial and/or diagonal fans. But if the cooling airflow has to be
deflected at an angle of 90°, for example, or if even greater pressure
increase is necessary, centrifugal fans are more effective.
For your application, ebm-papst offers not only complete centrifugal
fans, but also motor/impeller combinations without external housing.
Tangential fans: High air flow
with low pressure increase
Tangential fans are used especially to produce a wide airflow
distribution through devices. The air flows through the roller-shaped
impellers twice in the centrifugal direction: in the intake area from the
outside to the inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the
outside. Whirls form in the roller due to the vanes, which guarantee
a steady flow of air through the impeller.

Under ideal conditions, the operating point is represented as the

the fan is positioned at the air intake or exhaust side of the device.
In addition to ensuring the required flow rate, several other aspects
must be considered for determining an appropriate fan concept.
Multidirectional intake,
laminar currents
Information
The intake air currents of a fan are mainly laminar, comprising
nearly the entire suction area. By contrast, the exhaust air of a fan
is generally turbulent and flows in a preferred direction, such as
axial for an axial fan. The turbulence of the exhaust intensifies the
heat transfer from components within the air currents, so that
installing the fan on the air intake side of the device is recommen-

ded for cooling and heating. Installing the fan at the device intake
is also advantageous because the fan will not be subjected to the
Unidirectional exhaust,
dissipated heat of the device. Therefore, it operates at low ambient

temperatures and has a greater life expectancy.
Information on installation
When a fan is operated for the first time in an application,
the user may have noticed that the air flow in the device was
lower than expected. What is the reason for this?
■ The values stated in this catalog were determined under
optimum, constant, and comparable measurement conditions.
■ Due to manufacturing tolerances, both the speed of the
drive motor and the geometric shape of the fan impeller
are usually not exactly the nominal values but within defined
tolerance ranges.
!
■ Ideal installation conditions under which free air intake and
exhaust are present are seldom feasible in practice.
Quite frequently, the fans have to be installed in close proximity
to other components or cabinet panels. As a consequence,

air flow to diminish and the sound level to increase. Fans are

FanCheck
R4R Ready for Restart
FanCheck is a diagnostic tool integrated into the fan
electronics for determining the remaining service life
of the fan, dependant, upon temperature, speed, and
preset environmental parameters.
The FanCheck system emits a pulse width modulated
signal, which reflects the remaining service life of the fan.
The pulse width is proportional to the remaining service
life of the fan. The FanCheck signal has a pulse width of
10 % at the end of the service life and a pulse width of
90 % with full service life.
Basic data, such as the ball bearing system, bearing
lubrication or lubricant used, are programmed in advance
as parameters into the software.
The customer defines the environmental conditions,
such as the use of fans in moist, dusty, or dirty environ-
ments; other parameters such as ambient temperature
and speed are determined continuously. Based on all the
influencing parameters, the software can, by means of
a complex algorithm, calculate the remaining service life
for each individual fan.
IT equipment such as servers, routers, and in-row cooling
applications must be 100% operational. For this reason,
maintenance work is often carried out during operation.

Product overview
GreenTech EC axial fans
---
0
EC axial compact fans, in particular our new AxiACi series, stand for flexibility,
high efficiency and enable a wide range of applications.
The wide voltage possible in EC axial compact fans reduces the logistics costs and warehousing,
as the fan, regardless of the line voltage, can be used with its specified values: without switching,
the EC axial fan adapts to every power supply – from 90 to 264 VAC at line frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz.
Voltage fluctuations in the power system are automatically compensated for.
Unlike conventional AC technology, the state-of-the-art drive concept of this fan series is
not linked to a fixed power frequency. EC axial compact fans therefore offer a significantly
higher air flow and a significant pressure increase.
The extremely quiet and highly efficient motor impresses with its long service life
and is equally suitable for use in technologically demanding new projects and as a replacement
for obsolete AC solutions.

Product overview
AC axial fans
The tried-and-tested AC fans from ebm-papst are used wherever DC voltage is not available.
In addition to complete devices, you will also find fans without external housing. These offer
benefits whenever the air duct design can be integrated in the device that is being ventilated.
AC fans are available in many sizes, with variants with exhaust or intake over struts
with plug connection or exposed connection wires.
–
Fan drive using shaded-pole or capacitor motors based on the familiar external rotor principle.
This construction combining high performance with profitability.
All fan types are designed in IP20 as standard.
IP65 solutions and special protection types are available on request.

The air flow and sound level of fans without extemal housing depend on the installation conditions.
The stated air flow and noise have been measured with an orifice 76.5 mm Ø at a distance of approx. 17 mm from the mounting bracket.
The air flow capacity of fan series 8000 N is achievable because of the exceptionally favorable installation conditions.
The noise in the optimal operating range can be measured for these fans only in a specific application.

Product overview
AC centrifugal fans
PAPST
The tried-and-tested AC fans from ebm-papst are used wherever DC voltage is not available. In
addition to complete devices, you will also find fans without external housing. These offer econo-
mic benefits whenever the air duct design can be integrated in the device that is being ventilated.
AC centrifugal fans are available in many sizes with forward or backward-curved fan impeller.
Depending on the installation situation, it is a pure fan impeller or is combined with a housing
with optimized air flow and noise.
Fan drives through shaded-pole or capacitor motors usually incorporate the familiar external rotor
principle. This design combines high performance with economic efficiency. ebm-papst also offers
particularly flat AC fans with an internal rotor motor. The advantage of these is their fast start-up to
full speed, resulting in lower mass moments of inertia.
All fan types are designed in IP20 as standard.
IP54/IP68 solutions and special protection types are available on request.

The engineer’s choice
Axial fans
ebm-papst's axial fans prove their reputation as space-saving wonders by moving air for hot or cold
air exchange in a wide variety of devices and systems. Their outstanding features are their small
installation depth, low noise level and exceptional efficiency, and are particularly well suited for air
flow through heat exchangers.
Furthermore, in the EC version, they become intelligent ""energy-saving wonders"" for an extremely
wide range of applications, primarily in ventilation, air-conditioning and refrigeration technology and
the automotive industry.
One principle, countless options
The axial fan, the function of which is similar to
a propeller, moves the air axially, parallel to the
revolving motor shaft. The ebm-papst external
rotor motor is integrated directly into the axial
impeller, forming a compact axial fan unit. They
are usually installed with wall rings in short or
long nozzles.
The extensive ebm-papst product range offers
the right solution for each requirement and is
classified for a wide variety of applications:
S series with sickle-shaped blades for high

HMS controller
General remarks: The HMS controller is governed by a microprocessor and is specifically
–
designed for Heat Management Systems (= HMS). This controller allows for an almost
-
limitless programming variety as regards customer-specific fan speed / temperature
profiles. Moreover, this controller offers a multitude of the most diverse alarm
configurations.
Our HMS controller has been specially designed and adjusted to the product range of
ebm-papst in Mulfingen. Thus, any size of our fans or blowers can be used.
The most diverse of applications needing temperature-dependent control are possible.
Among these are applications in telecommunication and the IT industry, in refrigeration
and air-conditioning as well as in specific industrial plants and systems.

Measurement conditions for air and noise measurement
ebm-papst products are measured under the following conditions:
Axial and centrifugal fans with direction of air flow ""V"", without guard
–
grille and in the wall ring
Backward curved centrifugal fans, free-running and with inlet nozzle
–
Forward curved single and dual inlet centrifugal fans with housing
–
Noise measurements
All noise measurements are carried out in low-reflective test rooms with
reverberant floor. Thus the ebm-papst acoustic test chambers meet the
requirements of precision class 1 according to DIN EN ISO 3745. For noise
measurement, the fans being tested are placed in a reverberant wall and
operated at nominal voltage (for AC, also at nominal frequency) without
additional attachments such as the guard grille.
Sound pressure level and sound level
All noise levels are measured in conformity to DIN 45635 and
ISO 3744/3745 according to precision class 2 and specified A-weighted.
When the sound pressure level (Lp) is measured, the microphone is on
the intake side of the fan being tested, usually at a distance of 1 m on
the fan axis.
To measure the sound level (Lw), 10 microphones are distributed over
an enveloping surface on the intake side of the fan being tested
(see graphic). The sound level measured can be roughly calculated
from the sound pressure level by adding 7 dB.

Impellers
Impellers made by ebm-papst
Like pumps and compressors, fans and blowers belong to the category of aerodynamic and fluid work machines.
A fan consists of an impeller, a drive motor and a housing for suspension and for guiding the air flow. The blades spaced
along the circumference of the impeller are designed in such a way as to cause the flowing work medium to change
direction, thus passing on pressure and speed energy.

Effects caused by obstructions on the inlet side for constant air flow
EC centrifugal blowers
Constant air flow is attained with unimpaired inflow only.
An obstructed (e. g. asymmetrical or partially blocked) air flow can have a
significant effect on the curve behaviour and cause large deviations from
a constant air flow curve.
Examples of obstructed inflows
11
TIT
X
Instructions for designing a sufficiently unobstructed inflow:
The distance x between the blower intake and neighbouring walls or
–
obstructions should be at least 25 % of the impeller diameter.
Inflows with angular momentum or asymmetrical rotation should be
–
avoided.
The inflow can be made more uniform using resistances such as those
–
from filters or grilles.
On request, we offer calibrated blower designs that incorporate a specific
installation situation.

Motors made by ebm-papst
In AC and EC technology, ebm-papst relies on the proven external-rotor motor principle, with the rotor turning
around the stator within. Advantages of the ebm-papst external-rotor principle are:
Space saving design due to integrated bearings and direct installation inside the impeller
–
Lower load and more precise balancing of the bearing due to the fixed connection of all rotating elements
–
Prolonged service life due to the motor-impeller unit placed right within the air flow
–
The ebm-papst motors achieve very good results in efficiency and acoustic behaviour when used in EC technology.

Control technology
Open and closed loop control using ebm-papst technology
Depending on the field of application, fan speed has to be adjusted. In AC technology, the speed setting option can
result in an increase in installation expenditure and, typically, a less favourable noise performance and an increase in
power input.
Here, ebm-papst EC technology is a more eco-friendly and cost-efficient alternative. The EC motor with integrated
commutation electronics offers high efficiency across the entire speed range and optimal acoustic performance
at minimal installation expenditure.

SENSING TECHNOLOGIES
A full spectrum of custom cables
Cable assemblies for every application
Wilcoxon Sensing Technologies builds cables to our exacting standards for a variety of applications:
>> Industrial process
>> Hazardous areas
>> Paper machines
>> Predictive maintenance
>> Test & measurement
>> Machine tools
>> Condition monitoring
>> Transportation
>> High temperature/radiation resistant
>> Military specifications
>> Underwater
>> Maritime
Selecting the right cable assembly for a sensor is highly dependent on factors in the environment in which
the sensor will operate. It’s important to consider the application and the environment to ensure data
reliability.
An applications support specialist can help you determine the cable, protection level and connector fittings
that meet your needs. Custom cable orders are usually built in less than a week, and many standard cables
ship the next day. All cable assemblies are built with care and precision to ensure the quality you’ve come to
expect from Wilcoxon.

For harsh environments
Wilcoxon’s model 6Q (2-pin MIL-C-5015 connector) boot used with a Teflon® coated cable, such as model
J9T2A, has set the standard for ruggedized, submersible connector-cable assemblies. Rated IP68 and
tested up to 650 psi, 6Q connectors are usable in temperatures up to 200°C and underwater submersible to
a depth of 230 feet. The design of the 6Q allows it to be used both in settings where the cable shield must
be connected to the sensor body, and in industrial applications where the shield must be isolated from the
sensor (made possible by removing the grounding spring). The pairing of the 6QN neoprene boot and J9T2
